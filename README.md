# React Superhero App
This is the React Challenge of Alkemy.
It is an app made to create a superheroes team using an external API. Once we login, we can search for superheroes and choose them for our team. Also we can see the attributes each member of the team has.

# Technical background
* After login, a token is saved in localStorage. It allows us to keep the session.
* The Login Form and its validations, were made with Formik library.
* Bootstrap for styling.
* The API call was made with Axios library.
